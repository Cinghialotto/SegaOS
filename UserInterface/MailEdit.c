									preflight.
		<34>	 8/26/94	CMY		Auto-entry now works when the user has multiple players in the
									player list.
		<33>	 8/26/94	KON		Writing mail while registered is a warning rather than a yes/no

		<18>	 7/15/94	SAH		Updated to new DBPreflight interface.
		<17>	 7/13/94	CMY		Preflight to determine if there's enough room for outgoing mail.
		<16>	 7/13/94	KON		Added preflight to warn user that they may be interrupted if box
									is registered with the network.
		<15>	 7/12/94	CMY		Zero out the initValue so returning to MailView screen doesn't
									die.
