/*******************************************************************
The following ID Criteria seem to define uniqueness of cartridges,
in order of presumed importance:

1. Product Number

From $184 until $18e. This includes the publisher's ID code (e.g. T-81 
seems to be Arena Entertainment), the cart code, and version codes. The
version codes are all zeros in the carts I've seen, and they either follow
spaces, dashes, or commas.

The publisher's ID codes I've seen are "T-XX" for non-Sega, and "MK-1" for
Sega. On the carts I've looked at, it is always T-XX followed by a 
3 digit game code, or MK-1 followed by a 3 digit code. The only exception
I've found is NBA JAM which has "T-081326" (there is a zero before the
publisher's ID code of 81. So, perhaps the rule should be to find the
publisher's ID code after the first non-zero digit. Clearly, we need
to test this on more carts. Anyway, we get 1 bit as to whether it is
MK or T, and 5 decimal digits which yield around 16 bits, and since the
version codes seem to cluster around zero, we might just add their value
into the mix.

2. Check Sum

A short at $18E. Checksum appears to be a sum of all of the words in
the ROM, starting at address $200. This is 16 bits.

3. Country

Starting at $1f0, some permutation of up to one of each 'J', 'U',
and 'E' (for Japan, US, and Europe), until the first space. Order
does vary in the carts I've checked. That gives us 15 distinct
possibilities (about 4 bits), but certain combinations are much
more likely than others.

4. Copyright Date

Assuming we don't expect this product to live for more than 10
years, then use the x from 199x or 198x is at $11b, and the 3
chars of the month (e.g. "APR") from $11d to $11f. That is 10
possibilities for the year, clustered around the lower numbers,
and 12 possibilities for the month, possibly clustered around
certain months (e.g. for XMas intro). This yields a total of 
10x12 = 120 combinations, or about 7 bits.

5. Game name

Domestic use name: from $120 until first space or $150.
Overseas use name: from $150 until first space or $180.

Note that at least one cart, Tecmo Super Bowl, has no domestic
use name. Most of chars are the uppercase ASCII alphabet, but
char $87 occurs in TECMO SUPERBOWL, and "'" ($27) occurs in Street
Fighter II Champion Edition.

So...

Proposed method:

MSW: company/product number (16-bit binary representation of first five
non-zero digits after '-') + sum of all words from $180 through $18f.

LSW: Sum of all words rom $100 through $1ff.

This certainly could be defeated if someone deliberately tried, but
barring that, it is highly unlikely that it will accidentally match up.
And, if someone defeats it, we'll simply special case for that card.
